# Ironhack M3 Project
The main purpose is to practice and consolidate what we studied in Module 3 with focus on React (Hooks, Router), CSS frameworks/libraries, NodeJS and Express.
It will be a simple web app with 3 models and relationships, ability to CRUD, authentication and protected routes. 
Responsive design, error handling, 404 pages, Loaders/Spinners.
Two separate repositories: Backend (REST API) with Node and Express. Frontend with React.
